# snake_sfml
Fun project I am working on in my free time. It ultimately serves as a test bed for practicing new techniques and self study. 
My end goal for this project is to move it away from SFML as much as possible. Write a native Win32 windowing, sound, and input solution, and renderer  using Vulkan. I want the ability to use shaders to give it the look of running on a CRT screen with scan lines. Eventually, I want to write it into a full 3D application where you can play the game from an isometric view that can be rotated by the user.
